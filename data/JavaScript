  JavaScript is an object-based scripting language.
  The language is primarily used within a web browser and has the ability
  to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used in server programming,
  such as runtime environments such as Node.js.

  JavaScript was originally developed
  by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later
  as LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript. JavaScript has similar syntax to Java of Sun Microsystems,
  but this is because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language,
  and JavaScript is not directly related.
  Other than its name and syntax, it is more similar to self or skill than Java.
