  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the languages that describe how the markup language is actually displayed [1],
  and are often used in HTML and XHTML, and are also available in XML.
  It is the standard for W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.

  If the markup language (e.g. HTML) is responsible for the body of the website,
  CSS is responsible for decorating the website like clothes and accessories.
  In other words, changing the CSS file, while leaving the HTML structure intact,
  can be done like a completely different website.

  For the CSS3, currently under development, features have been added to replace images
  produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients, and deformation. In addition,
  various animation features have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
